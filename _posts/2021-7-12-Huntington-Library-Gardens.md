The other day I went to the [Huntington Library Gardens](https://www.huntington.org/gardens) with momo. The gardens were utterly beautiful and I haven't posted here in awhile, so I figured I'd put some of the pictures we took up here.

I have started to go out more and enjoy some of the things that I have stopped doing since the beginning of the pandemic. Things like stopping to smell the roses. ![roses](/assets/img/IMG_4953.jpg)

I've been able to explore more often with my amazing girlfriend. She inspires me and encourages me while I continue in my internship at [Arista](https://www.arista.com).

Summer in college is a very different time from the general year. While class is in session, you have a number of things to do at any moment. You must triage friends and class and work to get done the most you can in the time you have. 

However, summer is different for me. Even if I am working or camping or traveling, I still have time to breathe. 

Perhaps that is why we have this great attitude about summer; perhaps it is not the weather, or the fourth of july or barbeques in America. The essence of summer might just be more mindful than the rest of the year.
