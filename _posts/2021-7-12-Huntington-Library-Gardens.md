The other day I went to the [Huntington Library Gardens](https://www.huntington.org/gardens) with momo. The gardens were utterly beautiful and I haven't posted here in awhile, so I figured I'd put some of the pictures we took up here.

I have started to go out more and enjoy some of the things that I have stopped doing since the beginning of the pandemic. Things like stopping to smell the roses. ![roses](/assets/img/IMG_4953.jpg)
