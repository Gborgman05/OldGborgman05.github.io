I have been following [this][stats-course] basic statistics for data science course lately. The presenter is talking primarily from a healthcare point of view. At first, I thought that this might be less relevant than other statistics courses that are made by computer scientists, for computer scientists.

In reality, this course has been more interesting than many of the courses that I've taken that focus exclusively on the computer science perspective on a subject.

## Allowing your interests room to breathe

I find that as CS majors, or even general STEM majors, we focus so intensely on our area of study to the detriment of other areas. This habit is not unfounded, because there is seriously so much content that without a lazer focus, it seems like we cannot learn what we need to. 

However, I seem to learn best when I find differences in other fields: different perspectives motivate me to continue my core study. 

I study computer science because I love what you can do with the knowledge. Without a place I'm trying to go with my knowledge, I feel less motivated. I want to know what I can do with my knowledge, not just that I have more knowledge.
