I wanted to write out some ideas on the board game Spirit Island. Spirit Island is a cooperative board game that is the inverse of Catan.

In Catan settlers find new land and explore, build and exploit the natural resources. However in Spirit Island, you must protect the island from the incursion of evil and destructive settlers who spread like a disease and damage the very island itself. 

The mechanics and the themes meld incredibly in this game. Every turn the settlers destroy the land and build and explore more and it feels like you are always losing ground to them. It feels like there is an unstoppable tide of these enemies that you can barely hold the land in defense with. 


## Arkham HORROR

Arkham Horror is a cooperative campaign-driven card game where the players take the role of flawed, and specialized 1920s caricatures like: 

- the grizzled detective who drinks too much
- the violinist down on her luck
- and of course the depression-era bootleggers

These characters are fun and the difficulty of the game can lead into the feeling of unsurmountable odds and fear of the unknown â€” common themes within the game's domain: eldritch horror. 

The main issue with Arkham is their releases are quite expensive for the cards you get from it. This makes the game in general difficult to rationalize the cost.
