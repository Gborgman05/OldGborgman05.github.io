Sunday is a day with more uniqueness than many other days in the week. 


Monday is fairly unique in that it is the beginning of the week. There is typically a lot of new things, and it carries the unfortunate knowledge that most people dislike it. However I think that Sunday should get some more of the burden that Monday traditionally holds. 

Sunday carries with it the unbearable knowledge that time, and perhaps also life is short. It is suffused with a feeling of time running out and the hammer of another week sitting like the sword above the king.
