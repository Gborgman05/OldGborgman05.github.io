I've been writing thank-you notes for everyone who gave me presents for christmas and I was thinking about the optimal structure of a thank you note.

Here is what I came up with:

## Size

A thank-you note should not be written on full size letter paper. It should be approximately half that size, on a dedicated thank-you note card. The reduced size allows two benefits:

1. Less time to write a thank-you note!
2. Focused message of gratitude

The first benefit is perhaps selfish, but certainly relevant. Depending on how many thank-you notes you are writing, you need to save time! Writing thank-you notes for interviewers, family during the holidays, even work friends often comes in bunches. Save your effort so you can make as many thank-you notes as you need for **everyone**.  

The second benefit refers to the benefit of a space constraint. Your thank-ee does not have all the time in the world to read your note, so be respectfully brief. 
## Structure

## Signature

I always sign any letter with *"sincerely"*, but signing more casually with a thank-you note is best: use 

- *yours*
- *thank you*
- *with love*
