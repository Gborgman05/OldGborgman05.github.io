I wanted to write out some thoughts on treks and long journeys in general. A metaphor used is that "Life is a marathon". I think there are a few things about marathons that don't really fit though:

1. Marathon's are short

I mean relatively anyway, a marathon is, at maximum, a day. 

2. Marathon's really only test one thing

How long can you run. How much of life is focused around one thing? The people I admire are rarely the people that are only good at one thing. Certainly this warrants more discussion later. 

3. No one likes running

I mean the vast majority of people don't like running for no reason. I would suppose that most people do -in fact like living despite what they may say.
