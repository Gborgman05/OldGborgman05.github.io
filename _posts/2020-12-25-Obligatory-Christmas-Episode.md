# Flying During Covid-19

I flew on christmas day today. The airport was a little less crowded than usual, but somewhat the same. I sat at my gate with my girlfriend and considered how everything has become so normal to me. It is not at all odd that everyone was wearing masks of all different types; some people had plastic visors on and other people had disney branded masks. 

I take heart in this realization. I realize that we can adapt and adjust to things that are unimaginably different from what we are used to.

Just 9 months ago, wearing masks in the airport still seemed somewhat odd-feeling. Seeing people wipe down airplane seats or remain far away from each other was odd, but now it simply is not.

For the first 20 years of my life, the world seemed fairly stable, fairly set up and rigid in how it simply exists. Perhaps large changes happen some places, but NOT in my bubble. 

That bubble burst this year. 

## 2020 Takeaways

- the world can turn on a dime
- I want to move with it
- Talk to the people you care about
- Focus on one thing at a time
- Care about your derivative, not the y-coordinate of someone else
- better even, care about your acceleration!
